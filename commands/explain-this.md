- **Configuration**: Important constants, settings, and configuration values

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Optimization techniques and potential bottlenecks
- **Security**: Validation, sanitization, and protection measures
- **Error Handling**: Exception management and failure scenarios
- **Testing**: Testability and potential testing strategies

## Example Output Format

```
=Á Explaining: app/services/payment_processor.rb

=Ë File Overview:
  Type: Service Object
  Purpose: Processes payment transactions with multiple gateway support
  Dependencies: Stripe, PayPal APIs, ActiveRecord, Sidekiq
  Complexity: High (due to multiple payment methods and error scenarios)

<× Architectural Analysis:
  Design Pattern: Strategy Pattern for payment gateways
  Integration Points: Stripe API, PayPal API, internal billing system
  Data Flow: User ’ Controller ’ PaymentProcessor ’ Gateway ’ Database
  Error Strategy: Circuit breaker pattern with retry logic

= Code Breakdown:

  Class PaymentProcessor:
    Purpose: Orchestrates payment processing across different gateways
    
    Method #process_payment(amount, payment_method, user):
      1. Validates input parameters and user eligibility
      2. Selects appropriate payment gateway based on method
      3. Prepares payment data with required transformations
      4. Calls gateway API with retry logic and timeout handling
      5. Records transaction results and triggers post-payment workflows
      6. Returns standardized result object with success/failure status
    
    Method #handle_webhook(payload, source):
      1. Verifies webhook signature for security
      2. Parses payload based on gateway source
      3. Updates local transaction records
      4. Triggers business logic (fulfillment, notifications)
      5. Returns appropriate HTTP response

¡ Technical Considerations:
  Performance: Uses background jobs for slow gateway calls
  Security: Implements signature verification and input sanitization
  Error Handling: Graceful degradation with detailed error logging
  Testing: High test coverage with gateway mocks and webhook simulation

= Integration Context:
  Called by: OrdersController, SubscriptionService, RefundProcessor
  Depends on: User model, Transaction model, NotificationService
  Triggers: OrderFulfillmentJob, PaymentNotificationJob
  
=¡ Key Insights:
  - Uses adapter pattern to abstract gateway differences
  - Implements idempotency keys to prevent duplicate charges
  - Maintains detailed audit trail for compliance requirements
  - Designed for easy addition of new payment gateways
```

9  File type not suitable for code explanation: image.png
This command is designed for code files (.rb, .js, .ts, .py, etc.)
```

### Large Files
```
   Large file detected: app/models/large_model.rb (2,500 lines)
Explanation will focus on key sections and overall architecture.
Consider refactoring large files into smaller, more focused modules.
