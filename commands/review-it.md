# Review-It Command

**Command**: `/review-it`

**Description**: Conducts a comprehensive security and quality review of all changed files in the current branch using Claude's specialized pr-reviewer agent.

## What This Command Does

When `/review-it` is executed, Claude will:

1. **Smart Branch Handling**:
   - Check if current branch is prefixed with "tad/" (personal branches)
   - If "tad/" branch: automatically rebase with master and resolve conflicts before review
   - Use the same conflict resolution behavior as `/resolve-it` command
   - If conflicts exist after rebase, resolve them intelligently using project standards
   - Proceed with review only after clean rebase

2. **Branch Analysis**:
   - Scan all modified files in the current branch using `git diff --name-only HEAD^ HEAD`
   - Identify file types and apply appropriate analysis patterns
   - Understand each file's purpose and context within the project
   - Skip non-reviewable files (images, binaries, generated files)

3. **Security Review**:
   - Check for security vulnerabilities specific to the file type
   - Identify potential injection points or unsafe operations
   - Review authentication and authorization patterns
   - Check for data exposure or leakage risks
   - Validate input sanitization and output encoding

4. **Code Quality Assessment**:
   - Evaluate code structure, organization, and readability
   - Check adherence to project coding standards from `.cursor/rules/`
   - Identify potential performance issues and optimization opportunities
   - Review error handling patterns and edge case coverage
   - Assess maintainability and technical debt

5. **Best Practices Validation**:
   - Verify compliance with framework-specific best practices
   - Check for proper separation of concerns and SOLID principles
   - Review dependency management and version constraints
   - Validate testing patterns and coverage if applicable
   - Ensure consistent coding style and conventions

## Enhanced Workflow for Personal Branches

### For "tad/" Branches (Automatic Rebase + Review)

When executed on a branch prefixed with "tad/", the command performs:

1. **Pre-Review Rebase**:
   ```bash
   git rebase master
   ```

2. **Conflict Resolution** (if needed):
   - Detect merge conflicts using `git status --porcelain`
   - Apply intelligent conflict resolution using `/resolve-it` logic
   - Stage resolved files automatically
   - Continue rebase process

3. **Clean Review**:
   - Review only YOUR actual changes vs master (no noise from merged commits)
   - Focus on the diff between your branch and current master
   - Provide more accurate analysis of your specific contributions

### For Other Branches (Standard Review)

Standard behavior: review all modified files in current branch.

## Usage Examples

```
/review-it
```

**On "tad/" branch**: Rebases with master, resolves conflicts, then reviews your changes  
**On other branches**: Reviews all modified files in the current branch automatically

## Severity Levels and Decision Criteria

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL** - Must fix before deployment
- **Security vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass
- **Data exposure**: Logging sensitive data, exposing secrets in responses
- **Breaking changes**: Code that will cause runtime errors or system failures
- **Performance killers**: N+1 queries, infinite loops, memory leaks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING** - Should fix for better code quality  
- **Code smells**: Large methods, deep nesting, duplicated logic
- **Missing safeguards**: No input validation, missing error handling
- **Performance concerns**: Inefficient queries, unnecessary API calls
- **Maintainability**: Hard-coded values, unclear naming, missing tests

### ‚úÖ **PASSING** - Meets standards
- **Security**: Proper input validation and sanitization
- **Quality**: Clear structure, appropriate abstractions, good naming
- **Performance**: Efficient algorithms and database usage
- **Standards**: Follows project conventions and best practices

## Review Areas

### Security Focus
- **Input validation**: SQL injection, XSS, parameter tampering protection
- **Authentication**: Session management, password handling, multi-factor auth
- **Authorization**: Role-based access, resource-level permissions, privilege escalation
- **Data handling**: PII protection, encryption at rest/transit, secure logging
- **External dependencies**: API key management, HTTPS usage, certificate validation

### Quality Focus
- **Code structure**: Single responsibility, appropriate abstractions, clear naming
- **Performance**: Database query optimization, caching strategies, algorithm efficiency
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation, user-friendly messages, proper logging
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage, integration tests, edge case handling
- **Documentation**: Code comments for complex logic, README accuracy, API docs

### Standards Compliance
- **Project rules**: Adherence to `.cursor/rules/` standards and team conventions
- **Framework patterns**: Rails/React/etc. best practices and anti-patterns
- **Database patterns**: ActiveRecord best practices, migration safety, indexing
- **API design**: RESTful design, versioning, response consistency

## Output Format

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### No Modified Files
```
üîç Reviewing branch changes...
No modified files found in current branch.
üí° Tip: Make some changes and commit them, or use git diff to check unstaged changes.
```

### Non-Reviewable Files Only
```
üîç Reviewing branch changes...
Found 3 modified files (2 images, 1 binary) - no reviewable code files.
‚ÑπÔ∏è  Skipped: logo.png, app.exe, data.db
```

### Large Files Warning
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Large file detected: app/models/large_model.rb (1,200 lines)
This file may need to be reviewed in sections. Consider refactoring into smaller modules.
```

### Missing Project Standards
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  No .cursor/rules/ directory found
Using general best practices instead of project-specific standards.
Consider adding project-specific coding rules in .cursor/rules/
```

## Integration with Project Standards

- **Primary source**: Rules and patterns defined in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Fallback**: Framework-specific best practices (Rails, React, etc.)
- **Context awareness**: Considers existing project patterns and conventions
- **Actionable output**: Provides specific line numbers and concrete fix suggestions
- **Consistency**: Maintains review quality across different file types and team members

## Performance Considerations

- **File size limits**: Files over 1,000 lines receive focused review on changed sections
- **Binary file detection**: Automatically skips images, executables, and data files
- **Incremental analysis**: Reviews only files changed in current branch, not entire codebase
- **Parallel processing**: When multiple files exist, reviews are conducted efficiently
